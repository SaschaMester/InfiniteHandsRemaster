Licensing: This song is free art avaible under the following four licenses (for details, please visit 
draketo.de/licenses). Permission to filk her work freely was granted by Leslie Fish (cite: "Anything to keep the 
internet free: Go for it!" - she's great! - maybe you'd like to listen in on her music?) and CJ Cherryh.

- GNU FDL - GPLv2 or later or GPLv3 or later - Art Libre v1.3 or later - Lizenz für freie Inhalte v1.0 webstar

You can use any of those four licenses, because I can't yet know which license will make it to the general license 
for free art. Please keep all four licenses when you make changes, so we avoid licensing chaos. It doesn't use 
creative commons licensing, because cc does not protect the free avaibility of the sources (Just think LaTeX and 
pdf). Sources: infinite-hands.draketo.de
